      <description>A Pragmatic Introduction to
Secure Multi-Party Computation David Evans, Vladimir Kolesnikov and Mike Rosulek  Secure multi-party computation (MPC) has evolved from a theoretical curiosity in the 1980s to a tool for building real systems today. Over the past decade, MPC has been one of the most active research areas in both theoretical and applied cryptography. This book introduces several important MPC protocols, and surveys methods for improving the efficiency of privacy-preserving applications built using MPC.</description>
